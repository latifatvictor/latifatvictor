# Hi, I’m Lati 👋

I’m a Modern Workplace and Identity-focused IT professional specialising in the design, operation, and continuous improvement of Microsoft 365 platforms in enterprise environments.

My work sits at the intersection of **identity, endpoint management, security, and service ownership**. I focus on building workplace platforms that are secure by design, reliable in operation, and simple for users to work with every day.

---

## What I focus on

- **Modern Workplace platform ownership** across Microsoft 365  
- **Identity and access management** using Entra ID (Azure AD)  
- **Endpoint management and compliance** with Intune and SCCM  
- **Security-by-design** through Conditional Access, MFA, and governance  
- **Automation and operational improvement** using PowerShell  
- **Service ownership and reliability** using ITIL-aligned practices

## Why this GitHub exists

This GitHub is not about flashy code or side projects.

It is a practical collection of:
- Automation scripts  
- Platform configuration examples  
- Operational runbooks  
- Learning notes and design thinking  

Everything here reflects how I approach real-world enterprise platforms:  
**secure, governed, scalable, and user-centred**.

## How I think about technology

Good workplace technology should:
- Be **secure without being obstructive**  
- Be **reliable without constant intervention**  
- Fade into the background so people can focus on their work  

That principle guides everything you will see here.
