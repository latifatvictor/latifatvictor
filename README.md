# 👩‍💻 Cloud, Identity and Microsoft 365 Security Portfolio

Hello, I am **Lati**, working with modern workplace technologies and building advanced skills in Microsoft 365 identity, access management and cloud security.

My goal is to become a Microsoft 365 Security Specialist who can design secure identity architectures, automate tasks with PowerShell and strengthen security posture across cloud environments.

This GitHub showcases my hands on labs, study notes and projects as I progress through the Microsoft security certification path.
