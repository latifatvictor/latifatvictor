# Welcome to my Cloud, Identity and Microsoft 365 Security Portfolio

Hello, I am Lati. I work with modern workplace technologies and I am currently building deep skills in Microsoft 365 identity, access management and cloud security.

My goal is to become a highly skilled Microsoft 365 Security Specialist who can design secure identity architectures, automate processes with PowerShell and contribute to strong security practices in cloud environments.

This GitHub profile is where I document my hands on projects, my study journey and the skills I am building along the way.
