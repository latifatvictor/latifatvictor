## 👋 About Me

I am a **Microsoft Cloud Security & Identity Engineer** with a strong focus on **identity-first security, Zero Trust architecture, and cloud security operations**.

I work across the Microsoft security ecosystem to design and document **secure, scalable, and auditable security controls** that protect users, applications, and data in modern cloud environments.

This GitHub profile is a **professional security engineering portfolio**.  
It showcases **hands-on security implementations, architecture decisions, automation, and investigation workflows** aligned with Microsoft role-based security paths and real-world enterprise scenarios.

## 🧭 How This GitHub Is Structured

This profile is intentionally curated.  
Each repository represents **security engineering work**, not coursework.

You’ll find:
- 🔐 Identity & Access engineering scenarios  
- 🛡 Zero Trust and Conditional Access architectures  
- 🔑 Privileged access and governance frameworks  
- 🔍 Security investigations and log analysis  
- ⚙ Automation for identity and cloud security  
- 📊 Architecture diagrams and security flows  

All repositories evolve as part of **continuous professional development**, aligned with Microsoft security roles.

---

## 📂 Featured Repositories (Growing)

> Repositories will be published progressively as security domains are covered and implemented.

- **Cloud Identity & Access Security Labs**  
  Identity-first security scenarios aligned with Entra ID and Zero Trust

- **Microsoft Security Operations**  
  Defender and Sentinel-based detection, investigation, and response

- **Cloud Security Automation**  
  PowerShell and Graph automation for identity and security operations

Each repository is structured for **clarity, realism, and enterprise relevance**.

---

## 🧠 Security Philosophy

- Identity is the primary security control plane  
- Zero Trust is a design strategy, not a feature  
- Strong authentication reduces breach impact  
- Automation improves consistency and reduces risk  
- Visibility and logging are essential for defence  

Security controls must be **usable, defensible, and measurable**.

---

## 🎯 Microsoft Role Alignment

My work aligns closely with Microsoft role-based security paths, including:

- Identity and Access Administrator  
- Security Operations Analyst  
- Information Protection Administrator  
- Azure Security Engineer  
- Microsoft Cloud Security Engineer  

This GitHub demonstrates **applied security engineering**, not theoretical knowledge.
