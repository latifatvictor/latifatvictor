# Cloud, Identity and Microsoft 365 Security Portfolio

Hello, I am Lati. I work with modern workplace technologies and I am currently building deep skills in Microsoft 365 identity, access management and cloud security.

My long term goal is to become a Microsoft 365 Security Specialist who can design secure identity architectures, automate operational processes with PowerShell and strengthen security posture across cloud environments.

This GitHub profile is my learning space and portfolio. It contains my hands on projects, study notes, lab work and documentation as I progress through the full Microsoft security certification path.
